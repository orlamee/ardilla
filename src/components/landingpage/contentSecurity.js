              Data about you from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access,
              disclosure, alteration, and destruction. To prevent unauthorized
              access to your information, we have implemented strong controls
              and security safeguards at the technical and operational levels.

              designed to protect the confidentiality and security of your

              Ardilla limits access to your Personal Data to employees with a
              business reason to know such Personal Data, implements security
              practices and procedures designed to protect the confidentiality

              Where you have chosen a password that allows you to access certain
              parts of the website and mobile application, you are responsible
              for keeping this password confidential. We advise you not to share
              your password with anyone. We have also taken measures to comply
              with the provision of security facilities for protecting your
              Personal Data through firewalls, limited access to specified
              authorized individuals, encryption, and continuous capacity
              building for relevant personnel. We, therefore, have digital and
              physical security measures to limit and eliminate the possibility
              of data privacy breach incidents.

              Although we use appropriate security measures once we have
              received your Personal Data, the transmission of data over the

              endeavor to protect Personal Data, but we cannot guarantee the
              absolute security of Personal Data transmitted to us or by us. We
              will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we
              are legally required to do so.
