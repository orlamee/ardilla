              By using the Services, you authorise Ardilla to deduct any fees
              applicable to your User Account directly from your User Account
              (the “Account Fees”). Payment of fees generally will be made first
              from User Account assets in cash, next from the liquidation of
              cash equivalents, and finally from the liquidation of securities
              held in your Account. Until you terminate your Account, you will
              be deemed to reaffirm continuously your agreement that Ardilla may
              deduct the Account Fees from your User Account.
